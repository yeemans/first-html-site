<h1 class="header">An intro to making web pages:</h1> 
The structure of web pages is made using HTML, or hypertext markup language. 
HTML is what turns text into the structured webpages you see today and allows 
computers to use hyperlinks to direct users into other web pages. So, knowing 
HTML is an essential skill to anyone interested in creating websites.

<h1 class ="learn">Where can I learn HTML?</h1> 
<p class="sites">For learning HTML, I recommend the following:</p>
<a target = "_blank" href="https://www.theodinproject.com">The Odin Project:</a>  
The odin project is a compilation of free internet sources dedicated to teaching web development. The odin project teaches users how to work and setup a terminal, the place to type 
commands into the computer in addition to teaching html. It also has guides on how to use 
<a target = "_blank" href="https://github.com/">github</a>, a very common tool used to build and organize portfolios of code. 
<hr />
<a target="_blank" href="https://codecademy.com">Codecademy:</a> Codecademy is a 
site with courses that cover much more than just HTML. The courses introduce
a concept, then ask the user to complete a task that applies the concept. Only
part of each Codecademy course is free; the rest requires a paid membership.
